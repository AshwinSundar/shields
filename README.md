Spark Core Shields
=======

Repo for various Shields for the Spark Core.

Shields are boards designed to mate with the Spark Core that provide additional functionality. They might have sensors, LEDs, motors, batteries, and other components, and when paired with the Core provide a great starting point for a project.

The following shields are now ready for inhouse testing:

1. Relay Shield
2. Programmer Shield (JTAG)
3. Shield Shield

The Battery Shield is still under development and should be ready for a prototype run very soon.
